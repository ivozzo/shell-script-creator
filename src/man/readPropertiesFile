This functionality allows the script to read properties from a file.
The properties file has to be formatted using Sections as follows:

#Example
[SectionA]
varA=valueOfVariableASectionA
varB=valueOfVariableBSectionA

[SectionB]
varA=valueOfVariableASectionB
varB=valueOfVariableBSectionB

The properties will be declared dinamically inside your script and named according to this template: SectionName_VariableName

I.E.
SectionA_varA
